OpenModularTurrets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets.svg?branch=1.12)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets)
==================

Repo for [OpenModularTurrets](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/openmodularturrets) for Minecraft. It adds modular turrets that can be used to defend your base from players and mobs. This mod should be fairly well documented ingame, if you need any more help, ask us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SEG695u).  
Dev-Builds are available here (be careful, those are experimental and can break your save): [Click here](https://jenkins.ironhide.de/job/OMTTeam/job/OpenModularTurrets-1.12/)

For mod compatibility request we have 2 requirements:

1. The mod we should add compatibility for should not be inactive
2. It should be possible to contact one of the authors directly (from dev to dev)
