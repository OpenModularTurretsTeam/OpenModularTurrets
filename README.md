OpenModularTurrets
==================

Repo for [OpenModularTurrets](https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets) for Minecraft. It adds modular turrets, walls and fences that can be used to defend your base from players and mobs. This mod supports the ingame wiki mod (IGWMod) from Minemaarten and has most information available through it so we recommend to use that one.  

This is the GTNH Fork for 1.7.10
