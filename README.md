==================

Repo for [OpenModularTurrets](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/openmodularturrets) for Minecraft. It adds modular turrets that can be used to defend your base from players and mobs. This mod should be fairly well documented ingame, if you need any more help, ask us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SEG695u).  
Dev-Builds are available here (be careful, those are experimental and can break your save): [Click here](https://jenkins.ironhide.de/job/OMTTeam/job/OpenModularTurrets-1.12/)
